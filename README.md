# SimuBridge_with_ViewDashboard_Button
For visualizing the simulation output from Scylla, a visualizer tool developed with React is proposed.
Here we focus on the proposal of SimuBridge side.
Our proposed enhancement involves integrating a "View Dashboard" button within the "Run Simulation" interface of SimuBridge, specifically after the "Start Simulation" process concludes and the "Simulator Feedback" section appears. ⁤
⁤Currently, this section offers file download capabilities for simulation results. ⁤⁤The addition of the "View Dashboard" feature would provide a seamless link to the localhost:3001 page, where users could explore visualized data. ⁤
